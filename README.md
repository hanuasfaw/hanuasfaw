Selam, friend 👋🏾

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am Asfaw (pronounced /as•fa/), a high school computer science student. I have been coding since 2012 when I found Apple's (now dropped) [iWeb](https://www.apple.com/welcomescreen/ilife/iweb-3/) website builder. Since then, I've expanded to algorithms and data structures.

Hopefully you'll find some projects that are interesting and may inspire you. Everything is heavily documented, both in the READMEs and the source code itself.

Visit [my website](https://brehanubugg.com) if you want to learn more about me or see my other persuits. My résumé and socials are also on there. Feel free to reach out to me!

Until then,

Ciao. —Asfaw
